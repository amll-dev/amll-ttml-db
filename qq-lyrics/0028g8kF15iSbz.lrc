[01:58.931]Stand together like we're rocks in a wall
[02:03.627]Growing stronger everyday even more
[02:08.021]Stand together in the eye of the storm
[02:12.151]And show the whole world who we are oh
[02:17.319]Keep on walking to the sound of the drums
[02:21.800]Feel the fire run through our lungs
[02:26.414]Find our treasure in the light of the sun
[02:30.426]And show the whole world who we are oh
